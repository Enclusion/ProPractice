# ProPractice 3.0.7
I do not recommend anyone using this for production use, but rather as code reference.
It's unfinished, buggy, overall disgustingly written, but still works to some degree. Released upon request.

I might update it sometime soon.

AS FOR VERSIONS AFTER 3.0.7, THEY ARE ACTIVELY MAINTAINED AND THE DESCRIPTION ABOVE DOES NOT APPLY TO IT.
